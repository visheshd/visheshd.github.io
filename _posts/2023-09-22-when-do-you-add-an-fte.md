With each stage of growth comes a set of challenges and decisions that can determine the venture's fate. One such critical decision centres around scaling. When and how to expand the team. While hiring is often seen as a direct response to increased workload or an avenue to expedite projects, it's a nuanced operation that goes beyond filling vacant seats. Every addition to the team can either propel a startup closer to its Series A dreams or set it on a trajectory towards inefficiency, bloating, and, eventually, stagnation. 

## Why Companies Hire?
Companies hire to deliver faster on a roadmap or customers. As they try to push the limit of what they can do teams feel the pressure and their capacity is tested pushing them towards creating a new role.

During early growth, you'll encounter milestones that highlight the need to infuse additional skill sets into the team requiring you to create a headcount.

Some early-stage founders equate growth to headcount. There are a number of reasons why headcount gets created.

In the exhilarating phase of a startup's expansion, rapid headcount growth can seem like an obvious strategy. More hands on deck would presumably mean more work done, right? However, this logic can be misleading and potentially detrimental.

1. More Communication Lines, Often Leading to Inefficiencies:
The beauty of a small team lies in its cohesiveness and seamless communication. As the team expands, so does the network of communication channels. Each new member adds to this complexity. Which can hinder smooth communication, leading to misunderstandings, conflicts, or missed opportunities. Information might not flow as freely or as rapidly, resulting in delays and errors that weren't present before. Tangling the company in the web of its own making.

2. Decline in Revenue per FTE, a Warning Sign of Looming Inefficiency:
Another subtle yet alarming danger of unchecked headcount growth is the decline in revenue per Full-Time Equivalent (FTE). While at first glance, hiring seems like a solution to meet growing demand or complexity, it's vital to assess its impact on the bottom line. If revenue per FTE starts declining, it's often a sign that the startup isnâ€™t generating enough value for each new hire, suggesting a move towards inefficiency. It's not just about adding more players to the field; it's about ensuring each player contributes meaningfully to the game.

In essence, while growing a team is a natural step in a startup's journey, it demands careful planning and strategic thinking. A thoughtless surge in headcount can inadvertently slow down a startup, distancing it from its goals and vision.
  
## Balancing between specialists and generalists
Someone seasoned with experience and expertise in a set of things can do wonders to the level of execution.

However, deploying too many specialists can backfire. If you have specialised teams doing piece(s) of a project it introduces hand-offs that can slow things down significantly. And if you have too many specialists in one it can result in having too many chefs in a kitchen -- chaos is likely with each expert pulling in their own direction.

This can also result in a steep dive in revenue per FTE as specialists don't come cheap.

It's about recognizing the areas where expertise is paramount and aligning specialists accordingly. Conversely, in areas where adaptability and breadth of knowledge are more valuable, generalists should be the backbone. This balance ensures both depth and versatility in a team, optimizing for growth and innovation.

## Speed is essential
One key advantage of a startup is its speed. You want to ensure as a founding team you don't scale the team to a headcount and structure pushing them towards inefficiency and bloat.

## Practical Steps to Preventing Bloated Teams and Retaining Efficiency

### Single Threaded Teams 
Good single-threaded teams are small teams with team members and a leader equipped with all the resources they need to execute a project end to end.

Eliminating the need for complex communication outside the team. Allowing them to focus and deliver things at pace.

### 1. Balanced Team Composition
Crafting teams with a mix of specialists and generalists for optimal performance and costs.

### 2. Monitoring Revenue Per FTE
It's a crucial metric and it gives you an early indicator of the health of the company. If there is a lower trend on this you are clearly hiring aggressively and it needs to be a risk that you are aware of or are willingly taking.
   
### 3. Revisiting Pricing 
If there is indeed a downward trend with Revenue Per FTE and it is something you want to correct. You could either make cuts in terms of headcount. Or improve your unit economics by rethinking pricing.
   
### 4. The Power of Saying No
Many startups think they have to say yes to closing sales. A simpler thing to do is to build something of value by talking to enough customers and then selling that. If you consistently need to say yes to things that are not part of your standard offering you don't have a product market fit yet or you are selling to everyone under the sun instead of focusing on selling it an ICP.

Once you stop saying yes and eliminate projects that are over consuming resources you can reverse the trend downward trend in revenue per FTE.

## Conclusion
A few years of VC-backed startups demoing exponential growth with no sight of profitability and continuing for a while has set a bad culture. But the market is course correcting.
