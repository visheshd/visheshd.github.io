You have this amazing idea and perhaps even are the subject matter expert. But you need a tech co-founder.

Finding a tech co-founder is hard but has never been easier. You think there were too many dating sites, `founder dating sites` are not that far behind. But the problem I have with those are the problems people have had with dating sites. You are never sure of the what is presented and what the reality is.

Doing startup with someone is as huge as getting married to someone. You are betting your future and the future of the company on the sum of what you can do with them. To be in a position where you've lost a couple of years and feel like they are the reason for holding back the company is going to suck. Probably be a great `learning experience` but what if you could avoid it in the first place.

Getting someone who has done it before even if unsuccessfully is great but shouldn't be a requirement. As a startup CTO you need to find someone who knows the ropes but also is willing to get his/her hands dirty when needed.

## Ask your network
Find out if any of your connections have recently hired a CTO. Seek their advice. Ask people if they have any recommendations for a CTO or if they could help you find one. You'll be surprised you might get connected with. Getting setup by someone is way less riskier than working with a total stranger.

You could also search for CTO's that are connected to you at 2nd and 3rd degree. Reach out to them or get introduced to check if they are looking for something new.

## Tech events and hackathons
Attend tech events and hackathons where you would likely be meeting with people with the needed background. But don't try and recruit one there. Go there to generate some word of mouth about your startup. Checkout what the other developers are doing and if you find someone interesting follow up with them after the event to explore things further.

Remember developers do know these days that hackathons have become this hunting ground for recruiters but most of them go to build prototypes or learn a new things about the technologies they want to use or already use.

## Make it easier for a CTO to find you
You need to NOT only work hard to find a great fit but make sure you are working towards the right people finding you as well. List yourself on AngelList, Craigslist etc

Even without a CTO, show progress. It can be recruiting other co-founders, interns, potential customers, raising a friends and family round or a host of other things.

Evidence that you are passionate about the problem you are attacking can help tremendously in someone looking to be a part of a startup to approach you.


## Before the proposal
Spending a good chunk of the day with someone you see yourself working with is a great way to know if the relationship has any potential.

All the best with your endeavor! Please, suggest things you are planning to do or have done to expedite your search.
