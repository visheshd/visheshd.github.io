We’ve been using Grails for over 6 years now. It is an amazing framework built on solid foundations and allows us to 
build massive systems at a very fast pace. 

I had the opportunity to speak with Jeff Brown the founder of Grails and Steve Bowman from OCI. They asked me if I had 
any inputs to improve the community experience.

Few key things that I can think of within the eco-system that could be tweaked:

## College and Universities
College students need to be able to experiment with the technology more easily. Early adoption of the technology is key 
to its proliferation. Young developers get into PHP, Ruby, Python etc initially because these technologies have been 
around and ubiquitous. We need to promote other dev tools and platforms like Gradle, Heroku, OpenShift etc and make them as ubiquitous.

Grails has a large eco-system now but making it as popular as ROR or PHP on college campuses would need a bit of an effort. 

Community members perhaps need to present tech talks like:
1. Build your final year project in Grails
2. Prototyping your application faster with grails

## Creative Commons Material
Introductory material like slides for community members to present at colleges and user groups. These could be Creative Commons licensed.

## Reddit or similar community

Curated list of great blogs that the community could subscribe to. There are a lot of contributors already making 
contributions to channels like Reddit and Stackoverflow. But a little more encouragement might help.

## Education

Tying up with computer education institutes to provide coursework and training. Maybe adding a certification for both 
student and a tutor to become an OCI certified Grails student/tutors.

## Plugins

Possibly allowing users to request jumpstarting a defunct plug-in if there are enough requests then seeking someone 
from the community to revive it. 

## GR8Conf

The conference might be a great avenue to actually recognize community members and contributors. This might further 
fuel them to make a bigger impact.
