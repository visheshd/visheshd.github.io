His attention is limited.
Just like his predecessor.

After 2000-odd years of scrolling.
And being hooked onto their glasses.
Human attention isn't the same.

People don't want to explore.
They all crave to move in the same direction.
And so is he.

There are no crossings left to cross.
Just turns, tunnels and bumping into folks.
All, going in the same direction.

One wrong turn,
And it is going to be hours of following others.

However, he has it figured out.
Where his attention fails him, he relies on AI.
