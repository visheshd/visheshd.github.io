Awesome analytical skills and passion for solving complex problems are actually not that common in developers. 
Instead of looking out for these people, focus on what they look for. 

## Why should they join?
Developers are humans as much as the world would like to deny it; that is the truth. They are not code monkeys born to 
implement business requirements. They have their passions and as an organization when their passion aligns with yours; 
you will have an easier time attracting top talent.

Seek answers to this question.

## Technology
Try using a technology that has a passionate community, as your core technology. 

If you end up using a technology that has a smaller community but is really great. Take time to contribute in building 
the community for it. Contributions can range from code, documentation, evangelism and more.

## New tech experiments and avoid grunt work
Developers dread monotonous work. What they really crave for is a bit of autonomy and opportunity to learn new 
technology. Provide an environment where they could experiment. 

Most awesome developers don't like grunt work; build a culture where you build or use tools to eliminate grunt. A 
culture of continuous improvement at its core. Do things like improving dev-ops, side projects that are aligned with 
your organizationâ€™s mission.

We love technology and are passionate about solving problems. Our focus is to always be improving things around us.
