12 years ago, my CEO asked me what if I got hit by a bus.

I smiled, first thinking he was joking. 
And then I realised he was serious. 
But I couldn't stop smiling. 

The stoic in me today would have said, "Well, I'll be dead most likely".

I assured him the codebase and architecture are well documented. All he has to do is spend 5X to find someone as good as me. 

He was happy to hear about the documentation.

Business continuity is not something you want to forget.
