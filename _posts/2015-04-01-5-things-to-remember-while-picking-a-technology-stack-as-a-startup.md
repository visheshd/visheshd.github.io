It is a daunting task to start to build a software product that is going to be the next big thing. One of the challenges
that you might face very early on is to pick a technology stack before you begin. A lot of times it boils down to the tech
founder(s) expertise with a particular stack. But most of the times you are better off looking at it objectively.    

As a tech founder sometimes you want to work on cutting edge stuff that is still in its alpha or beta release. Primarily 
you are simply blown away from some of the advantages it listed even though some of them might be theoretical. It's great to be 
an early adopter but probably experimenting with a technology on a project that you want to get out the door in a month 
or two is not a good idea. It might still work but before you take that leap do consider the following things.

## 1. Is it a good fit for the problem you are trying to solve
Should I pick Ruby On Rails, Sails, Yii, Grails or something else. Is it SQL vs NoSQL. For a mobile app is it a native 
app vs a hybrid app. Are you building something that is going to be dealing with real time data. 

These are just some of the basic things you head into but as you think about them make a list of user goals you are trying
to achieve and your target user profile. 

For example:
1. Like what kind of user projections are you realistically looking at to support for the first few versions
2. Is your primary user base going to be likely an iPhone user
3. What kind of age group they would fall into. This could again give insights into the devices and browsers to
	expect.
4. What kind of data are you dealing with?
5. By when do you intend to get it live?

and look at options at places like [stackshare.io](http://stackshare.io/trending/tools)

## 2. A decent sized developer community 
You want to work on stack that you are either very familiar with or that has a decent sized development community. More 
importantly it needs to be responsive one, for this look at the their repos, stackoverflow and mailing lists to see how 
fast questions by others are getting answered.

It also helps to see Google Trends to get an idea of well a technology has been doing for a period of time. Here is an
example of [trends worldwide for Grails, AngularJS and node.js](https://www.google.co.in/trends/explore#q=famo.us%2C%20%2Fm%2F0dj45_%2C%20%2Fm%2F0bbxf89%2C%20angularjs&cmpt=q&tz=).

## 3. Stability 
When we started using famo.us for a product way early, it impacted our timeline for a private beta. Their release cycle
is excruciatingly slow. They've had [12 releases since April 2014](https://github.com/Famous/famous/releases) but 
there are numerous bugs (imagine user click broken for 3 months) and outstanding pull requests that are just taking 
forever. When you are trying to get a product out the door and validate things, getting a version to the users is 
much more important then using the latest and greatest tech. Being an early adopter is great for side projects or a 
version you might be doing on the side to explore things. Relying on it while you are building an MVP is probably not a good idea.

## 4. Learning curve
The learning curve ultimately has to be manageable. As engineers we are always picking up new things, but you don't want
to spend all your time learning when you could be actually moving towards the launch. Before looking at options, it's 
important to look at the available tech skills.

## 5. Hiring and scaling the development team
Hiring is probably one of the most important things you need to think about before starting out. What is the time line
you are looking at to hire more people? Is the stack you are about to start with tough to pick up? Is the architecture 
layered nicely and do you think different components are loosely coupled. Things like readability, using patterns and a
consistent approach by all developers make it easier to make changes, fix things and add more people to the
mix and all these things get impacted by technology stack you pick. 

Picking a good stack is very important but the faster you can validate if you are solving a 
pain or building a "nice to have" product the better. Get your product out there, learn from user feedback and iterate. 
You are unlikely to find the perfect stack when you start and there is absolutely nothing wrong in improving things 
gradually as you learn more. Behind the scenes you could change the entire stack or a few pieces depending 
on the need.
