> Did you hate the movie, Oppenheimer? It quotes Bhagawad Gita and I am probably about to share another one that could be "the life hack".

## Philosophy Behind The Hack

Lord Krishna says to Arjun, "You only have the right to carry out your duties. I (Krishna) will decide if you get a reward, if any, and what it will be. So there is no point in worrying because it is not your decision".

Which is very aligned with the Stoic wayâ€”the dichotomy of control, a timeless truth. Fret not over the uncontrollable, but instead, channel your energy into what's in your control.

Attaining indifference to outcomes is hard if not impossible for us mere mortals; discovering and pursuing genuine passions can make that easier but is no easy feat.

## Things become the focus

Regrettably, money's rise predates the Gita by four centuries and our primal instinct for self-preservation is genetically encoded. Marketing and sales exploit these, perpetuating an unyielding cycle, as evidenced in our closets' contents.

You think: "Ah well, we are all taught this as kids in some shape or form".

We are - this and more. Our innate need to shield our children from any pain present or future has pushed generations before us to point us in many directions that seem far less important.

## So the hack

Devote x% of your time to doing things that intersect with what you genuinely enjoy and can impact others positively. Be as generous as you can afford to be. In most cases, it will pay for itself and more.
