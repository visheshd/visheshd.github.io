## 1. Exceeding expectations and attention to detail
Exceeding expectations and attention to detail are a huge part of our culture. We look for candidates who've done the 
same in the past positions, resume and during the interview.

## 2. Have they taught themselves things?
"A" players are great self learners, they love doing things that they have never done before and are way beyond their years.

## 3. Their work and resume speaks for them
They don't have to sell their achievements too hard.

## 4. Have the self belief and humility
They are not cocky but their answers convey a level of self belief.

## 5. They know what they want
They have a pretty good idea of why they are interested in the position and the organization.

## 6. They are eager to work for it
During an interview you will see them trying to arrive at a solution instead of reluctance to answer.

## 7. Do they have something new to learn?
"A" players love new challenges and they will seek positions that provide them with ample challenging opportunities.

We look for roughly 70% - 30% split. Where they have 30% of the responsibilities or skills that they've never done before or used.

## 8. Have they been promoted in their previous role 
Have they been promoted in their previous organization. People getting promoted within the organization is a stronger signal
of them being an "A" player compared to people who only get promoted when they happen to switch jobs.
