There is little money around in the market.  Do you know if you are you VC-fundable? Let's dive into the signs that might suggest otherwise.

**1. You're Not Venturing into Generative AI**

Money is being thrown at pretty much only this category right now. 

**2. Your Revenue Game Isn't Strong**

Gone are the days when VCs poured money into ideas without substantial financial promise. Now, they're on the lookout for SaaS companies that can showcase a triple growth in revenue during the initial two years, followed by doubling the sales in subsequent years. If this sounds like an uphill task for you, it might be an indicator that the VC world isn't your playground.

**3. The Sky Isn't the Limit for Your Market**

If your total addressable market isn't colossal, think in the ballpark of $1 billion or more, VCs might take a step back. They're not just looking for a good idea; they're looking for a good idea that can scale up and become a global phenomenon.

**4. You Value Business Autonomy**

Venturing into the world of Venture Capital often means surrendering a chunk of control. Whether it's about dictating growth rates or influencing business valuations, VCs have a stake in the game. If you're someone who fiercely values autonomy and prefers charting their course, the VC route might not be your best bet.

**5. Your Intellectual Property Isn't Crystal Clear**

A clear economic moat, or a sustainable competitive advantage, is often grounded in intellectual property. If you're wading into waters where the IP isn't distinctive, or if you don't have an economic edge that sets you apart, VCs might hesitate to back you.

**In Conclusion: Chart Your Path**

While VC funding is often viewed as the golden ticket, it's essential to remember why you started your business in the first place. A successful venture isn't solely defined by hyper-growth or vast sums of funding. Sometimes, it's about staying true to your vision, growing at your own pace, and making a genuine impact.
