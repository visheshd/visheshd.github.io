# Vishesh Duggar
For over 15 years, I've harnessed my tech expertise to architect solutions for companies such as Vamstar, Oura Health, Precise.ly, NthJen, and many others. My passion lies in scaling web, mobile, and tech products to new heights, fueling growth and innovation.

A driving force behind my work is a deep understanding of the unique needs of consumers/patients in the US, Europe, and India. I've navigated health/privacy regulations and tackled user experience challenges with finesse.

My specialization spans diverse areas including health tracking, telemedicine, wearables, health systems integration, research software for health and pharma, and beyond. I'm your trusted advisor, offering invaluable insights into the ever-evolving landscape of health tech.

My repertoire of technologies is vast, from Node, React, Serverless, AWS Lambda, CloudFormation, Grails, Groovy, Java, Spring, ReactNative, Cordova, and Python, and I keep myself updated. I am still very hands-on and code.

Let's transform your tech vision into a captivating narrative, making it super-sellable and shareable. DM for a chat on LinkedIn.
